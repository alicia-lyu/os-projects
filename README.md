# OS Projects

This is a collection repo of projects I did for CS 537 Operating System. All projects are written in C.

- [Basic Shell](https://github.com/alicia-lyu/basic-shell): A basic shell that has redirection, pipes, loops, and multiple commands built in.
- [xv6 Stride Scheduling](https://github.com/alicia-lyu/xv6-stride-scheduling): Implements stride scheduling in xv6 kernel. Introduces the notion of priority and optimizes the original Round Robin scheduling.
- [xv6 Copy-on-Write Child Process Creation](https://github.com/alicia-lyu/xv6-CoW): Implements Copy-on-Write (CoW) `fork()` in the xv6 kernel. Improves memory efficiency compared to the original `fork()`.
- [Parallel Sorting](https://github.com/alicia-lyu/parallel-sort): Utilizes Linux pthreads for efficient data sorting.
- [Ext2 Disk Image Checker](https://github.com/alicia-lyu/disk-checker): Inspects an ext2 disk image to recover deleted jpg files.
